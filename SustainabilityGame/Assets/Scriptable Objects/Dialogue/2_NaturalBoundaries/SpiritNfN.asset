  dialogue:
  - You chose to respect the natural boundaries, and make a temporary settlement.
    Very well.
  - Because you settle in places that can't sustain humans for long, your people
    will be travelling around a lot.
  - In fact, the society you will create will be fully nomadic, taking what they
    can and then leaving the land to recover.
  - Lets look at another key moment of your journey, just after setting up camp
  - Your party has climbed a nearby hill to map the surrounding area
  - You've decided to make some sort of symbol, or artpiece, to commemorate the founding
    of your settlement.
