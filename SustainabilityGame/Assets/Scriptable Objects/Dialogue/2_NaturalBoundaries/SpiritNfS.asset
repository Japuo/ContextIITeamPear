  dialogue:
  - You chose to cross natural boundaries to settle in the most efficient places.
    Very well.
  - Because you did this, the society you will create will not shy away from reshaping
    nature when deemed necessary.
  - Of course, to avoid previous mistakes, this time they have made sure to do so
    responsibly, giving back to nature what they took, but in a more convenient place.
  - Lets look at another key moment of your journey, just after setting up camp
  - Your party has climbed a nearby hill to map the surrounding area
  - You've decided to make some sort of symbol, or artpiece, to commemorate the founding
    of your settlement.
