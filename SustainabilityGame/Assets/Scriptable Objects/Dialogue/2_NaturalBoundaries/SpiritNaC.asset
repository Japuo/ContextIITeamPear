  dialogue:
  - You chose to settle near a large tree that survived the cataclysm. Very well.
  - Because you settled near a natural remnant of the old world, the society you'll
    create will do so as well. Their cities and towns will be built where they find
    things like old trees, rock formations, or cave systems.
  - In the future, they'll use these places as their town centers, and as places
    to worship or to hold outdoor events.
  - Lets look at another key moment of your journey, just after setting up camp
  - Your party has climbed a nearby hill to map the surrounding area
  - You've decided to make some sort of symbol, or artpiece, to commemorate the founding
    of your settlement.
