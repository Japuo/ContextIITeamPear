  dialogue:
  - You all seem very lost. Just like this land. Hmmmm...
  - But you are capable of shaping a new future for this place.
  - You are the leader of this group. You inspire these people.
  - 'The land south of here is a lot more restored than the wasteland you see now. '
  - With your influence, and my guidance, we can change it so your people can settle
    here once again. I have forseen it.
  - Humanity tried the pragmatic way, although barely. Look where it got us.
  - We cannot take that path again. But there are many alternative paths. The choices
    you will make in the future will influence those paths.
  - The triangle on my right is the Nature Futures model, a model about the interaction
    between Human and Nature.
  - After you make choices, you can see how they influenced your place on the Natures
    Futures triangle!
  - If you want to know more about the Natures Futures model, click the Learn More
    button in the menu.
  - Now, let me show you the future!
  - In a few years time, you will be trekking through the land, trying to find a
    place for a settlement.
  - However, you ran out of rations, and have to find food.
  - It might seem like a small choice, but the way you do so will have great impact
    on the future of this place.
