  dialogue:
  - You chose to make art from natural sources.
  - In the future, artists will also do that. Wooden and stone sculptures will be
    common.
  - I hope you're getting the picture now. It's not so hopeless after all!
  - 'Let me show you one last thing. Let me show you the society you would have shaped
    with these choices '
  - This is 200 years from now, if you make the choices like you just made them.
