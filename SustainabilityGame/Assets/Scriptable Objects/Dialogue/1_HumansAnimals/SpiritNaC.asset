  dialogue:
  - You chose to observe animals to help you find food. Very well.
  - It might have felt small, but the choice you just made will define the way humans
    interact with animals for generations.
  - Your followers will have learned that animals are guides. In the future, they
    will be seen as sources of wisdom
  - Lets look at another key moment of your journey, a few days later.
  - 'The time has finally come to set up your first settlement. '
  - It's just going to be some tents or huts for now... but it will be a city in
    the future!
