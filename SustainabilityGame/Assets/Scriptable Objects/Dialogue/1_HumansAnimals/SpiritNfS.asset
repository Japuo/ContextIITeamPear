  dialogue:
  - 'You chose to hunt for food. Very well. '
  - It might have felt small, but the choice you just made will define the way humans
    interact with animals for generations.
  - Your followers will have learned that animals should serve society. As food,
    or as work animals.
  - Lets look at another key moment of your journey, a few days later.
  - 'The time has finally come to set up your first settlement. '
  - It's just going to be some tents or huts for now... but it will be a city in
    the future!
